# Wine Quality Prediction App

# About this app

This is a small project that uses a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on some chemical tests. The model learns from past data and then guesses how good a new wine might be.

# inside this file you can see,

- A trained model saved as "model.pkl" 
- A Jupyter notebook that shows how the model was trained ("model_training.ipynb")  
- The Streamlit app code ("app.py") where you can enter wine details and get predictions  
- A list of required Python packages in requirements.txt 
- This file â€” README.md  

# About data

The data is from the Wine Quality dataset, which has measurements like acidity, sugar, and alcohol content for many wine samples, plus a quality score.

I aleady uploaded the dataset, also you can get here
